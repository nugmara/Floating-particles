# Particle Animation with Whale

<img src="./images/particle-whale.gif"/>

This JavaScript code creates a captivating particle animation with a whale sprite moving in the background. The particles are attracted to the whale, creating an engaging visual effect.

**Caution: Be mindful of the number of particles you create, as some computers may struggle to handle a high particle count.**

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you understand and run the particle animation on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To run this code, you need a modern web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript. No additional libraries or dependencies are required.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nugmara/Floating-particles
   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Once you open \`index.html\` in your browser, you'll see the particle animation in action. The particles are attracted to the whale sprite, creating dynamic movement.

### Interact with the Animation

You can interact with the animation using your mouse:

- Move your mouse to control the whale's position on the screen.
- Click and hold the mouse to change the whale's position.

### Customization

You can customize various aspects of the animation by adjusting parameters in the JavaScript code:

- Number of particles: Modify the \`numberOfParticles\` variable to change the number of particles on the screen. Be cautious not to set it too high on computers with limited resources.

- Particle behavior: Adjust the \`Particle\` class properties to change how particles move and interact with the whale.

- Whale properties: Modify the \`Whale\` class properties to change the whale's appearance and behavior.

- Canvas size: The canvas size is set to match the window dimensions. You can customize this behavior in the \`resize\` method of the \`Effect\` class.
